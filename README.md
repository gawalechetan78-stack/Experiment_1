# EXPERIMENT 1(A): BASIC C++ PROGRAM

## AIM
To write, compile, and execute a basic C++ program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console, in order to understand the fundamental structure and syntax of a C++ program.

## TOOLS USED
- **Language**: C++
- **Compiler**: g++ (GNU Compiler Collection)
- **Platform**: Linux / Windows / macOS (any system with a C++ compiler)
- **Editor/IDE**: Visual Studio Code / Code::Blocks / Terminal-based editor

## THEORY
A C++ program typically begins with the inclusion of necessary header files, followed by the definition of the `main()` function which serves as the entry point for execution. In this experiment, we use the `iostream` header to handle output operations. The `cout` statement from the standard namespace is used to display text on the console. 

This experiment reinforces understanding of:
- The structure of a basic C++ program
- The importance of header files
- Standard output using `cout`
- Returning a value from the `main()` function

### ALGORITHM
1. Start
2. Include the necessary header file (`#include <iostream>`)
3. Define the `main()` function
4. Use the `cout` statement to print "Hello, World!" to the console
5. Return 0 to indicate successful execution
6. End

## CONCLUSION
The program was successfully compiled and executed, producing the output "Hello, World!" on the console.

# EXPERIMENT 1(B): BASIC ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS IN C++

## AIM
To write a C++ program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two user-input integers and displays the results.

## TOOLS USED
- **Language**: C++
- **Compiler**: g++ (GNU Compiler Collection)
- **Platform**: Linux / Windows / macOS (any system with a C++ compiler)
- **Editor/IDE**: Visual Studio Code / Code::Blocks / Terminal-based editor

## THEORY
Arithmetic operations form the foundation of many computer programs. This experiment is designed to reinforce the understanding of:
- Taking user input using `cin`
- Using arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) in C++
- Displaying formatted output using `cout`

The program prompts the user to enter two integers and performs the following operations:
- **Addition**: Adds both numbers
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies both numbers
- **Division**: Divides the first number by the second

It is important to note that in integer division, any fractional part is truncated.

### ALGORITHM
1. Start
2. Declare variables for two integers and four results
3. Prompt the user to input two integers
4. Read the values using `cin`
5. Perform:
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division
6. Display the results using `cout`
7. End

## CONCLUSION
I successfully wrote and executed a C++ program that takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations on them. Through this experiment, I understood how to handle user input, apply arithmetic operators, and display output in a structured format. It gave me hands-on experience with the fundamental building blocks of programming in C++.
